# iCEStick-Quadrater-Decoder
This is a verilog project defining an I2C slave device that decodes a number of quadrature decoder pairs and maintains an int32 count. This project is built using PlatformIO's tentative support for the iCEStick development board for the iCE40-HX1K FPGA from Lattice Semiconductor Inc.
